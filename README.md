# SubHealthAI: Early Detection Before Diagnosis

SubHealthAI is an **AI-powered preventive health project currently in development**.  
Its purpose is to analyze wearable and lifestyle data to identify **early warning signals** and **subclinical patterns** that often go unnoticed in traditional healthcare.  
The goal is not to provide a medical diagnosis, but to **support physicians today** with a long-term vision of **empowering individuals under physician oversight** by surfacing trends that may warrant preventive attention.

---

### Why this matters
- Chronic diseases account for almost **90% of U.S. healthcare spending** ($4.1 trillion annually).  
- Many conditions begin with **silent inflammation or early dysfunctions** that existing diagnostic tools miss.  
- By offering physicians and eventually individuals a clearer view of these early risk patterns,  
SubHealthAI has the potential to lower long-term costs and improve health outcomes.  
- All development follows a **privacy-first design** and will align with **HIPAA and FDA digital health guidelines** during clinical testing.

## 🔍 What SubHealthAI Actually Does
Most wearable apps today provide raw metrics (HR, HRV, steps, sleep) in isolation.
They rarely integrate these into meaningful health patterns or long-term risk insights.

SubHealthAI is different. It provides a **structured "early warning" layer** on top of wearable and lifestyle data:

1. **Cross-signal integration**  
   - Combines multiple inputs (HRV decline, rising resting HR, accumulated sleep debt, activity instability).  
   - Surfaces dysfunction patterns that single-device apps cannot reveal.

2. **Subclinical risk flags (not diagnosis)**  
   - Generates explainable “early warning flags” such as possible inflammation risk or metabolic strain.  
   - Each flag includes supporting rationale and confidence scoring.

3. **Longitudinal tracking**  
   - Analyzes rolling 7/30/90-day trends instead of one-night snapshots.  
   - Captures slow-moving dysfunctions and reduces false positives.

4. **Multimodal roadmap**  
   - Now (MVP): wearable + lifestyle inputs.  
   - Future: optional patient-provided lab results (e.g., CRP, HbA1c, vitamin D) to increase precision.

5. **Clinician-ready outputs**  
   - Weekly plain-language notes for users.  
   - One-tap PDF/Email reports with tables, charts, and citations designed for physicians.

By sitting between raw wearable data and clinical diagnosis, **SubHealthAI fills a critical gap**:  
Turning fragmented signals into structured, explainable insights that support earlier interventions.

## 🚀 What We’re Building (MVP)
- **Data ingestion** from wearables, lifestyle tracking, and behavioral inputs  
- **Signal flags**: rule-based indicators (e.g., sleep debt, HRV decline, elevated resting HR)  
- **AI-generated weekly note**: plain-language report summarizing risks and trends  
- **Clinician export**: one-tap PDF/email report with tables, charts, and references  
- **Audit logging**: system-wide transparency for trust and reliability  

This repository contains the **starter codebase**, database schema, and demo UI for the MVP.
